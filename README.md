# LogisticRegression-HeartDisease-prediction
This project uses **logistic regression** to predict **heart disease** based on patient health data. The workflow includes:

- **Data preprocessing**.
- **Feature selection** using high-correlation features.
- **Scaling numeric features** for model training.
- **Training and testing** the logistic regression model.
- **Evaluating performance** using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Making predictions** on new patient data.
